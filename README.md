## Skillup-Poymorphisim

**Polymorphism** is the ability of a variable, function, object or class to take on multiple forms while sharing the same underlying data or common interface. for instance a Class of Human can take the form student, father, Baby e.t.c.
Polymorphism can be dynamic(runtime) polymorphism or static(compile time polymorphism).
## Types of Ploymorphism
**Dynamic polymorphism** applies the same interface for methods on different type of objects. In other words it allows the same inputs, give the same outputs but different methods on the objects. 
for example a class of Animal can have form bird and dog
bird:chirp(sound), dog: bark(sound). in plain terms the class animal has two objects(forms) that implement the method sound differently.

**Static Polymorphism**
In static Polymorphism a method from the same class can share the same name and take different set of inputs.
When a method is called the actual method invoked depends on the type of arguments supplied.
## Advantges of Polymophism
1. It makes codes and applications reusable and extensible.
2. It enables a single variable to store multiple data types.
3. It can be used to create interchangeable Objects which can be selected based on needs.

## Disadvantages of Polymorphism
1. It is complex to understand and use.
